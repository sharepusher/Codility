1. default sotrage engine: WiredTiger - Provide collection level cocurrency; and compression, save disk; 
2. Compression: with wired-tiger, compression for both collection and index. 
   Compression minimize storage use at the expense of additional CPU.
   By default, WiredTiger uses block compression with SNAPPY library for all collections and prefix compression for all indexes.
   "zlib" is also available for compression, which is an abstraction of the DEFLATE compression algorithm(an LZ77 variant that uses Huffman coding).
   Zlib is very common on many software, and is the basis for the gzip file compression.
   Compression can be set on a per-collection and pre-index basis during collection and index creation.
