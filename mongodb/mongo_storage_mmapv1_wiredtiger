## Explanation
WiredTiger scales on modern, multi-CPU architectures.
Using a variety of programming techniques such as hazard pointers, lock-free algorithm, fast latching and message passing.
WiredTiger performs more workr per CPU core than alternative engines.
To minimize on-disk overhead and I/O, WiredIger uses compact file formats, and optionally, compression.
# advantages
low storage costs; greater hardware utilization; more predictable performance, especially by reduing query latency in 95th and 99th percentile.
Between 7x and 10x Greater write performance improvement for most write-intensive application.
# upgrade
non-disruptive for existing replica set deployments; 100% compatible; zero downtime through a rolling upgrade of the MongoDB replica set.

# performance
Write performance: 
    WiredTiger provide Document-level concurrency control; mmapv1 is collection-level concurrency control, so the former is better.
Read performance: both of them excelllent.
Compression support: mmapv1 do not support.
Query/Secondary/Replication/Sharding/Security both them supported.
